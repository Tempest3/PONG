; Author: Brandon Michaud & Konrad Wiley
; Date: 12/4/12 -- 12/6/12
; Runs in 16-bit real mode. Made with Irvine's make16 batch file.

; Note:
; This program ran so quickly on Konrad's computer that it was entirely impossible to play.
; To try and alleviate this complication, two counting methods are in place to slow the ball down.
; If performance on your particular machine is not stellar... or if you want a bit of a challenge...
; comment-out the counting section from lines 337-342 (approx.). This will double the game speed.
